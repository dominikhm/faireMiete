Collection of code that creates a map of a city (in this case SF) with certain interesting real estate metrics and functions such as a slider or a hover function. 

sfmap.py is the basic code used. It can be deployed locally on a bokeh server or to a heroku webapp. The Procfile and requirements.txt are necessary for the webapp.
