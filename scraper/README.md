Here we have code that uses puppeteer to create a webscraper. We have the following file structure:

browser.js - starts browser instance
index.js - receives browser instance and hands it over to pageController
package-lock.json 
package.json - dependencies and metadata
pageController.js - steers scraping process
pageScraper.js - actual scraping happens here
